	"longdescription": "# devi_binja\nBinary Ninja Plugin for devi. For a detailed description how devi works see its [repository](https://github.com/murx-/devi/). This plugin uses the newly introduced possibility to add cross-references in binary ninja to devirtualize virtual calls. \n\nDevi consits of two components, one for dynamic analysis (DBI) and one for static analysis (disassembler). This repository is only the static analysis part for binary ninja. See https://github.com/murx-/devi/ for the details of the dynamic part. \n\n\n## Minimal Example\n\n### Disassembly\n\nBefore:\n\n![Disassembly before devi](https://github.com/murx-/devi_binja/blob/master/images/main_before_devi.png?raw=true)\n\n\nAfter:\n\n![Disassembly with devi](https://github.com/murx-/devi_binja/blob/master/images/main_after_devi.png?raw=true)\n\n### XRefs\n\n\nBefore:\n\n![Xrefs before devi](https://github.com/murx-/devi_binja/blob/master/images/xrefs_before_devi.png?raw=true)\n\nAfter:\n\n![Xrefs after devi](https://github.com/murx-/devi_binja/blob/master/images/xrefs_after_devi.png?raw=true)",
